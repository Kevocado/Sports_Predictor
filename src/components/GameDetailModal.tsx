 * so the earlier claim that the model projects exactly one market per position was

 *
 * The arithmetic still holds, for a different and verified reason: summing the
 * roster's yardage fields adds a QB's passing to an RB's rushing and a WR's
 * receiving, and the total is not any real quantity. On a full roster it ran
 * 800-1400 yards against a real figure of roughly 300-450.
 *
 * What is *not* safe is to rely on each player having at most one yardage field. If
 * `POSITION_MARKETS` ever gives a position two yardage markets, the parts still do not
 * sum to the old single-field total, and the correct rendering is one row per market
 * with the player counted in both -- which is what this does, and which
 * `test_binds_each_market_label_to_its_own_value` and its sibling now pin.
 * Team total yards is `rushing + receiving` across every player, which needs a

 * its pre-game rows as exactly ONE heading: `${home_team} vs ${away_team}` and
 * nothing else. Every sentence that used to sit under it moved into the instant
 * block as a figure, one of them, which left the live pre-kickoff modal with a
 * bare `CLE vs PIT` heading above the AI button and no text under it at all.
 * The `finished` branch is a different story and still carries real rows (the
 * result, and the pick's rightness once the verdict has reconciled), and
 * `in-play` carries the score and the standing — so the name is NOT deleted from
 * the flow; it is withheld only from the one state that renders it alone.
 *
 * The rule this implements: **the heading appears only where a row can follow
 * it.** Pre-game there is no row to follow, so the bundle carries no name and
 * `FixtureFlow` renders an empty flow — the honest reading the package's own
 * header describes ("A state with nothing to say renders an empty flow"). That
 * is also what it already does for a sport with no home and away side, so this
 * is the same path rather than a new one.
 *
 * It costs nothing else. `InstantBlock` names the pick through
 * `bundleFacts.fullTeamName`, which falls back to the pick's own label when the
 * bundle has no `home_team` to match it against — and this site's label is
 * already the full team name — so the block's verdict line, its tiles, its bar
 * and its record are unchanged. The `score`, `result` and `pick.was_right` rows
 * that the two other states word never read the name from these two fields on
 * this path either: `resultSentence` names the side off `score`, which is where
 * the name comes from on a final. `GameDetailModal.leftovers.test.tsx` asserts
 * all of it on the live payloads, per state and per sport.

                  Position-market projections, not team total yards. These cover the whole

                  yardage market per position, so QB rushing and RB receiving are missing.
