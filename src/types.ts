// Track record (B6)
//
// These are transcribed from what the trackers EMIT, not from the design spec's
// data contract, and the two do not fully agree. Read
// NFL_Predictor/src/nfl_predictor/tracking/store.py::get_track_record and
// _summarize_games before changing anything here -- the spec is a description,
// that function is the contract.
//
// Where they differ, the emitter wins and the difference is named:
//
//  - The spec's `WeeklyRow` carries `pct_total_error`, `total_mae` and
//    `total_bias`. B4 did NOT put them there. Every week of every points
//    forecast lives in its own `totals`/`margin` block with its own `weekly`
//    list, and the field is called `signed_error`, not `bias`. So `WeeklyRow`
//    has none of the three.
//  - The spec's `totals: { n, mae, bias, weekly }` is emitted as
//    `{ n, mae, signed_error, weekly }`.
//  - `weekly_trend` is GONE (B3) and is not kept alongside `weekly` for
//    compatibility. Two shapes for one fact is how this page shipped a
//    `types.ts` that read `{bucket, n_resolved}` against an API emitting
//    `{label, n}`, and rendered a section that had never once appeared in any
//    deploy. The CFB backend is still on the old key -- see the optionality
//    note below.
//
// The new keys are OPTIONAL, and that is not hedging. CFB_Predictor has not
// had B2-B5 applied to it: its `/track-record` still emits `weekly_trend`, no
// per-market counts, no points forecasts and no `vs_market`. This one site
// serves both sports off `?sport=`, so making these required would take the
// CFB tab from "behind" to "throws", which is the failure B6 exists to end.
// A section whose data the payload does not carry renders a visible
// not-recorded state on the page, which is the same rule the backend applies
// to a week with no picks.
