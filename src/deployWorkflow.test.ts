/**
 * A merge to main must deploy to the VPS, and nothing else should.
 *
 * The deploy workflow existed only for Azure, was `workflow_dispatch`-only, and
 * had no VPS job at all, so a merge deployed nothing. This pins the
 * replacement, because the failure mode it guards is silent — a workflow that
 * does not run looks exactly like a workflow with nothing to deploy.
 *
 * The same contract is asserted in the five Python site repos as
 * `tests/test_deploy_workflow.py`. It is duplicated rather than shared because
 * there is no shared test runner between a Vite/vitest frontend repo and five
 * pytest repos, and a deploy guard that only exists in one of the six is a
 * deploy guard that exists in one of the six.
 *
 * This repo has no scheduled job that commits to main, so there is nothing to
 * exclude by name. `checkNoCatchAll` is the invariant that still bites here:
 * a bare `**` in the filter would match every commit, so any refresh job added
 * later would redeploy the service on every run.
 *
 * The one check here that is not a copy from a sibling is the credential.
 * `checkCredential` asserts `secrets.GHCR_PAT`, and it exists because the
 * original version asserted the opposite. Requiring `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` here
 * would have failed on the first merge with
 * `denied: permission_denied: write_package` *after* a clean build, because
 * ghcr.io/kevocado/sports-predictor is user-scoped and not linked to this
 * repository. That is indistinguishable from a permissions bug and is not one.

/**
 * The GHCR login must use a credential this repository can actually push with.
 *
 * `GITHUB_TOKEN` would be the target state — a PAT is a credential that outlives
 * the repo and has to be rotated by hand — but it may only write to packages
 * LINKED to its own repository, and ghcr.io/kevocado/sports-predictor is not:
 *
 *     gh api /user/packages/container/sports-predictor --jq '.repository.full_name'
 *     -> null
 *
 * So the push dies with `denied: permission_denied: write_package` after the
 * image has already built and tagged correctly, which looks exactly like a
 * permissions problem: `packages: write` is declared, and it is correct. NFL and
 * CFB both lost their first deploy this way. Linking a package is a one-time
 * action in package settings with no API, so nothing in CI can notice.
 *
 * The PAT is already a secret on this repo and is what these images have always
 * been pushed with. If that `gh api` ever returns
 * "Kevocado/Sports_Predictor", switch the workflow back to
 * `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` and change this check in the same commit.
 *
 * Matched on the `password:` field rather than the name appearing anywhere, so
 * the workflow's own comment can say what the alternative would be. Exactly one,
 * so a second login step cannot smuggle in a second credential.
